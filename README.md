âš¡ Random fact: Programming can be a lonely business, but programmers have a secret weapon: rubber ducks. In a practice called [rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/), programmers explain their code line by line to a rubber duck, allowing them to spot errors and find solutions. These specially trained rubber ducks might not talk back, but their mere presence helps programmers clarify their thoughts and uncover bugs. So, don't be surprised if you see a programmer deep in conversation with a rubber duckâ€”it's just a quirky, yet effective, way to debug and bring a little more humanity to the coding process.
