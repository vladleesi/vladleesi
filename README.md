âš¡ Random fact: Programming is a bit like talking to ducks. Rubber ducks, to be precise. The concept of **'rubber duck debugging'** involves explaining your code, line by line, to a rubber duck. By articulating the problem out loud, you often discover the solution yourself. So, if you ever catch a programmer conversing with a rubber duck, don't worry, they're just engaging in some productive debugging banter with their trusted companion.
